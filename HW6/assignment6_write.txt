	the program prints hello 4 timmes,
	fork looped total 2 times there for 2+ 2 = 4

8.12
	the program prints hello 8 timmes,
	2^3

8.13
	x=4
	x=3
	x=2
	fork first does ++x
	then fork does nothing thus x=3
	then does the line 10 x =2

8.14
	hello
	$hello
	hello
	child is triggered and prints two hello, then themain program prints hellpo

8.16
	counter = 2
	when fork is triggerd coutner = counter -1

8.23
	only parent prcess count child process as signal, it increments when child is born.counter counts  when a child is died.  handler blocks rest of signals when proceing one signal. Thus they are pending, thus there is a bug.
